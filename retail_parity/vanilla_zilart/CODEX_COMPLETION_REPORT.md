# Codex Completion Report — Vanilla + Rise of the Zilart

Status: BOUNDED_PASS_COMPLETE_PROJECT_IN_PROGRESS

## Branch and source state

- Repository: `djjohnson13p/server`
- Work branch: `retail-parity/codex-vanilla-zilart`
- Starting commit: `9461b8d918135f97738710bb0dad8e8371f7d984`
- Pinned upstream baseline: `242ab0d055dfb80396e7398b0dd7361b750c74e2`
- Upstream pull requests: none; prohibited
- Upstream push: disabled/prohibited

The inherited-correction validation pass is complete. Five corrections are
implemented and test-backed. Shadowbind is a test-backed partial correction
because its exact accuracy, relative-level, duration/resist, and Recycle
coefficients remain unsupported by sufficient evidence.

## Tests added by finding

### `VZ-ZONE-001`

`scripts/tests/zones/temple_of_uggalepih_doors.lua` adds five interaction
cases for:

- exact Uggalepih Key acceptance, consumption, key-break message, and opening;
- wrong and non-exact trade rejection without consumption;
- `_mf9` locked-side Uggalepih Key message;
- unchanged `_mf8` Prelate Key consumption/opening/messages;
- both existing unlocked-side coordinate checks.

### `VZ-ECON-001`

`src/test/tests/fishingutils_tests.cpp` calls the production moon-dispatch
seam for patterns 4 and 5 across all eight defined moon phases and proves the
curves remain independent.

### `VZ-ECON-002`

The same Catch2 file proves Waders, Fisherman's Boots, and Angler's Boots
survive the production feet filter, reach their configured lucky-timing
branches, and unrelated feet remain filtered.

### `VZ-ECON-003`

`src/test/tests/conquest_system_tests.cpp` covers 0%, 10%, 100%, small and zero
awards, a negative modifier, and explicit fractional truncation. Production
still passes only the adjusted point value into the unchanged
nation/region/IPC aggregation path.

### `VZ-JOB-002`

`scripts/tests/jobs/rng/abilities/shadowbind.lua` adds nine action-path cases
for:

- success and `IS_EFFECT`;
- controlled failure and `JA_MISS`;
- existing Bind;
- immunity, resistance-trait, and nullification guards;
- ammo consumption on success/failure;
- Unlimited Shot ammo preservation and effect consumption;
- Ranger level-39 rejection;
- Ranger subjob level-40 availability.

The Lua simulation player factory now accepts optional `sjob`/`slevel`
parameters for the subjob action test.

### `VZ-CORE-001`

`scripts/tests/systems/combat/call_for_help.lua` adds nine real Help-action
cases for:

- one eligible mob with no active target;
- multiple eligible mobs and one success message;
- retained enmity after unclaim;
- party claim without/with requester CE or VE;
- pet claim without/with master CE or VE;
- already-enabled and explicitly blocked mobs with one failure message;
- battle-ID and confrontation boundaries.

`src/test/tests/battleutils_tests.cpp` directly covers the production instance
identity seam for non-instanced, same-instance, and different-instance
entities.

## Defect discovered and corrected

The inherited Call-for-Help implementation accepted requester ID membership
in an enmity container. A focused claim-transition case demonstrated that
stale personal enmity could remain after a mob became unclaimed. The action
could therefore mark an unclaimed mob.

Eligibility now requires:

- a live mob not already help-enabled or blocked;
- matching confrontation, battlefield, instance, and battle ID;
- a current requester/party/alliance claim through `HasClaim`;
- positive requester CE or VE.

The action still iterates through `ForEachMobInstance`, changes every eligible
mob, and sends exactly one success or failure message.

## Exact validation commands and results

### Fresh configure

```text
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" -no_logo -arch=x64 -host_arch=x64 && cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build-codex-validation --fresh -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF -DTRACY_ENABLE=OFF -DPCH_ENABLE=OFF -DCACHE_OPTION=sccache
```

Result: exit `0`; CMake `4.3.3`, Ninja generator, MSVC
`19.44.35228.0`, x64 Debug.

### Test executable build

```text
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" -no_logo -arch=x64 -host_arch=x64 && cmake --build build-codex-validation --target xi_test
```

Result: exit `0`. The final post-format rebuild completed `26/26` steps and
linked `xi_test.exe`.

### Isolated current-schema test database

The installed local `xidb` was not modified because it lacked the current
`mob_resistances.stun_res_rank` column. A uniquely named disposable database
was created and populated with current repository SQL:

```text
python tools\dbtool.py update
```

The command ran with `XI_NETWORK_SQL_*` pointing to
`xidb_codex_validation_20260725_1435` and the existing local `xi` account.
Result: exit `0`; all SQL files imported and no migrations remained.
Credentials were never printed or stored in repository files.

### Focused Catch2 and Lua run

```text
.\xi_test.exe --keep-going --file shadowbind --file call_for_help --file temple_of_uggalepih_doors
```

Result: exit `0`.

- Catch2: 16/16 test cases, 9,007,070 assertions passed.
- Lua: 23/23 tests in six suites passed.
- Final Lua duration: 19.239 seconds.

### Lua style

```text
python tools\ci\sanity_checks\lua_stylecheck.py scripts\tests\jobs\rng\abilities\shadowbind.lua scripts\tests\systems\combat\call_for_help.lua scripts\tests\zones\temple_of_uggalepih_doors.lua
```

Result: exit `0`.

### C++ formatting

Modified/new C++ and header files were formatted with:

```text
C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\clang-format.exe -i --style=file <modified C++ files>
```

Version: `clang-format 22.1.8`.

### Complete Debug build

```text
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" -no_logo -arch=x64 -host_arch=x64 && cmake --build build-codex-validation
```

Result: exit `0`. The complete all-target pass finished `148/148` remaining
steps after the focused test target and linked `xi_connect`, `xi_world`,
`xi_search`, and `xi_map`. The final post-format all-target check also exited
`0` and relinked the affected world/map executables.

### Diff validation

```text
git diff --check
```

Result: exit `0`. Git emitted only expected line-ending notices for files
whose checkout normalization is configured by the repository.

### Cleanup

- `build-codex-validation`: removed.
- Generated root `xi_*.exe`/`xi_*.pdb`: removed.
- `xidb_codex_validation_20260725_1435`: dropped and confirmed absent.
- Working local `xidb`: not modified.

## Intermediate failures resolved

- The first test compile found missing `fishingutils::` qualifiers in the new
  Catch2 translation unit. The test was corrected; the next build passed.
- The first local Lua attempt could not authenticate with the default
  `root/root` settings. The repository's existing local `xi` credentials were
  used without disclosure.
- The working local `xidb` was schema-stale. It was left untouched and replaced
  for testing by the disposable current-schema database.
- Initial Lua fixtures exposed out-of-range Shadowbind targeting, wrong
  locked-door-side positioning, and unsafe repeated Help actions in one
  party/pet fixture. The fixtures were corrected to model the real action
  paths.
- A manufactured cross-instance live-enmity fixture proved unsafe and was
  removed. Instance identity is covered through the production C++ boundary
  seam; the action itself remains scoped by `ForEachMobInstance`.

## Findings now fully test-backed

- `VZ-ZONE-001` — server-side Uggalepih/Prelate door behavior.
- `VZ-ECON-001` — moon-pattern dispatch.
- `VZ-ECON-002` — Waders branch reachability.
- `VZ-ECON-003` — conquest region-bonus arithmetic and truncation.
- `VZ-CORE-001` — server eligibility, scope, claim/enmity distinctions,
  boundaries, and message cardinality, subject to the client limits below.

## Finding still partial

`VZ-JOB-002` remains partial only where evidence is insufficient:

- `/RNG` accuracy penalty, if any;
- relative target-level correction;
- ranged-accuracy contribution;
- whether `BIND_MEVA` is the correct terminal roll;
- duration/partial-resist rules;
- Recycle behavior beyond the tested Unlimited Shot path.

No spell-skill, dSTAT, ranged-accuracy, subjob, or level formula was invented.

## Client/live-retail-only candidates

- Temple door rendered timing and complete mission-route traversal.
- Fishing curve coefficients and exact Waders magnitude.
- Conquest fractional rounding if retail differs from current truncation.
- Call-for-Help reward suppression, outside-player attackability, claim
  color/radar, and rendered client update. Source tracing supports these paths,
  but this pass does not label them end-to-end validated.
- Shadowbind numeric accuracy/level/duration/resist/Recycle behavior.

## Recommended next pass

Begin `VZ-CORE-002` attack while fishing with a safe cancellation/state
transition and focused action/state tests. Then continue `VZ-BF-001`,
`VZ-COMBAT-001`, `VZ-JOB-001`, `VZ-SYS-001`, and the exhaustive
Vanilla/Zilart audit in bounded passes.
